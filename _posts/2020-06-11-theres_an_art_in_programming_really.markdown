*And, don't be affraid of code reviews.*

I know from experience that there's art in programming.  Or, rather, artistry in the creation of a program (or collection of programs).  And in a couple of different ways, too.  

First, say we give 10 programmers the same task.  It doesn't matter what the task is, only that it requires a program and the same result by all.  One programmer writes 2,000 lines of code to produce the result.  Another programmer writes 200 lines of code.  Maybe the overall average is 600 lines of code.  Each of the 10 programs produces the same exact result.  So the question is, is one program better than the others?  From a purely mathematical standpoint it'd be easy to say that the 200 line program is the best and the 2,000 line program is the worst.  But let's add a bit of subjectivity into the equation.  

Comments, does the shortest program have good comments?  Afterall, a program will need to be maintained, updated, improved, etc.  If I open a program that has no comments my job just got tons more difficult.  Converseley, does the 2,000 program have lines and lines of narrative?  Ditto, my job just got a lot more difficult.  In either case I'm not a happy camper, quite upset in fact.

Efficiency, is this the apotheosis of programming?  I'd argue not.  The 200 line program may be so perfectly efficient that simply changing a single word could completely change the program or break it entirely.  Tread extremely carefully when you're in a supremely efficient program.  It's likely that the 2,000 line program is sloppy, plain and simple.  Maybe they're not making good use of functions, constantly repeating code, and simply not using the language as intended.  Maybe not, but it'll be a bear to maintain either way.

The artistry is in balancing the outcome with the density of the program itself while also writing sufficient comments about what's happening.  This will be a welcome gift to your future self (or someone else) when the program is long forgotten but suddenly needs updating.  2,000 lines!  Ahhh, it'll take forever just read this meandering thing!  Or, for the 200 line program, Great Scott this is a dense program!  (trigger the ominous music while I begin to sweat and click each key as though I'm playing russian roulette.)  

Which is to say, in this case I'd prefer the 600-1,000 line programs - they should have a good balance of efficiency and terseness with a healty dose of comments.  It's not easily done.  

Of course, the caveat, always, is that maybe the 2,000 line program is by someone new to programming?  We should definitely applaud their effort.  Code reviews are always good, especially for new programmers (or existing programmers learning new languages).  It could be a great learning experience.  Even the code reviewers may learn something new, because the new programmer may find wonderfully novel ways to use the language.  Everybody wins!  

I'm returning to programming after being away for a really long time.  So long that I consider myself a beginner.  I will definitely be writing those 2,000 line programs, and even then they might not work right.  That's the sad truth of doing something new and challenging like this.  I just hope it also comes with some progress.  That would be nice.  I'll definitely work hard towards progress, just don't know if my aging and wonky brain is up to the task - we shall see.
