<p>Why "The Sound and the Fury?"  There's a story to that, but probably one for another time.  So about me, I'm a midlife professional and I've decided to revisit programming.  I learned HTML 2 way back in the 90's and database programming around the same time.  Which is to say (or write, rather) that I'm a tech dinosaur - that's my history.  But more importantly, where do I want to go, what's my future?  That's the big question, one I'm hoping to find out in my journey back to programming.  So much has changed with technology.  Before I even decided to return to programming I gave myself the test of at least trying to write a modern program.  Was it fun?  Could I even do it?  Was it rewarding?  So I watched a bunch of videos on programming in Swift within XCode - Apple's IOS language and development environment.  I downloaded the environment and got to work.  Long story short, I did it!  I wrote a simple card program, War, that pops up a picture of my son at our county fair in front of a water gun game when the cards are equal.  I loaded it onto my phone and played it.  I showed it proudly to everyone in my family.  My son was quite pleased to see his picture in an IOS game.  What a genuinely satisfying experience, one I think is quite similar to a builder building a beautiful house with nothing but 90 degree angles and straight lines, or a chef making the perfect fish meuniere, or, well, you get the picture, except in my case it's the builder building a single and simple wall, studs only, or the chef rinsing the fish.  That was the level of programming I did to test myself.  No matter, I proved to myself it was the right path for me.  So what's next?  The daunting task of learning to be an employable full stack software engineer.  Which is to say, no easy task at all.  And as for this blog, I'm not much of a blogger, so this is new territory for me too.  I hope I can keep it up, and if so, it's at least moderately meaningful, relevant, and even lighthearted.  So many new things!  Onward!</p>
